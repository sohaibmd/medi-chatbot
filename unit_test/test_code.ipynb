      "Fever, or pyrexia, is a temporary increase in the body's temperature above the normal range, typically considered to be 98.6°F (37°C) orally.  It's not a disease itself but rather a symptom of an underlying condition, often indicating that the body's immune system is fighting off an infection or other illness.  The body's thermostat, located in the hypothalamus region of the brain, is responsible for regulating temperature.  When the body detects a threat, like bacteria or a virus, the hypothalamus raises the set point, leading to a higher body temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Causes of Fever:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Fevers are caused by a wide range of factors, primarily infections but also including other conditions.  These include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Infections:** This is the most common cause.  Viral infections (like the flu, common cold, or COVID-19), bacterial infections (like strep throat, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections), and parasitic infections can all trigger a fever.  The body's immune response to these pathogens releases pyrogens, substances that signal the hypothalamus to increase the body's temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Non-infectious causes:**  While less common, fevers can also result from:\n",
      "    * **Autoimmune diseases:** Conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation and fever.\n",
      "    * **Certain cancers:** Some cancers can lead to fever as a symptom.\n",
      "    * **Adverse drug reactions:** Some medications can trigger a fever as a side effect.\n",
      "    * **Heatstroke:**  This is a serious condition caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures, leading to a dangerously high body temperature.  While technically a different mechanism, it still manifests as an elevated body temperature.\n",
      "    * **Blood clots:**  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) can sometimes cause a fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Symptoms of Fever:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary symptom is an elevated body temperature, measurable through various methods like oral, rectal, axillary (armpit), or tympanic (ear) thermometers.  Other symptoms that often accompany a fever include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Chills:** Feeling cold despite a rising temperature.\n",
      "* **Sweating:** Excessive sweating, especially as the fever breaks.\n",
      "* **Headache:**  A common symptom, especially with viral infections.\n",
      "* **Muscle aches:**  Also common, particularly with viral illnesses like the flu.\n",
      "* **Fatigue:**  Feeling unusually tired and weak.\n",
      "* **Loss of appetite:** Reduced desire to eat.\n",
      "* **Nausea and vomiting:**  More common with certain infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Treatment of Fever:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause and managing the symptoms.  In many cases, a mild fever will resolve itself without specific treatment, as the body's immune response combats the infection.  However, symptomatic relief is often sought:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Over-the-counter medications:**  Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help reduce fever and relieve aches and pains.  It's crucial to follow dosage instructions carefully.\n",
      "* **Hydration:**  Drinking plenty of fluids (water, clear broths) is essential to prevent dehydration, which can worsen the symptoms.\n",
      "* **Rest:**  Getting adequate rest allows the body to focus its energy on fighting off the infection.\n",
      "* **Cool compresses:** Applying cool, damp cloths to the forehead can provide some relief from the discomfort of a high fever.\n",
      "* **Sponge bath:** A lukewarm sponge bath can help lower the temperature.  Avoid cold water, as this can cause shivering and potentially raise the temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While many fevers resolve on their own, it's crucial to seek medical attention if:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The fever is very high (over 103°F or 39.4°C).\n",
      "* The fever lasts for more than three to five days.\n",
      "* The fever is accompanied by severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, stiff neck, rash, confusion, or seizures.\n",
      "* The fever occurs in infants under three months of age.\n",
